# Various-Assembly-Programs

Gaining familiarity with MIPS Assembly.
Tasks 1 through 8 involved simple tasks and problems to be solved with MIPS Assembly, using a Mars emulator. Tasks were first completed using 
Python, and then implemented in Assembly.

Task 1: Evaluate the boolean of the input's yeap lear status. Output a message reflecting if it is, or isn't a leap year.
Task 2: Create a list from user input, and output the list in reverse order.
Task 3: Creates a list of integers from user input and outputs the floating point average for the entirety of the entries.
Task 4: Completes a search for an query temperature in an unsorted list of temperatures to return the Boolean of its existance in the list.
Task 5: Implement task 4 as a called function.
Task 6: Sort a list of temperatures using a selection sort fucntion.
Task 7: Use sorted list from task 6 and implement a find_median function that finds and outputs the median of the sorted list.
Task 8: Create a list from use input, sort the list and then use a recursive binary search function to find the Boolean of a 
	query temperature's existance in the list.
